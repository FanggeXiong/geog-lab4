# geog-lab4 - Landfill in Seattle with a rocky theme
In lab4, I made four tile sets of Seattle. The map can be accessed [here](http://127.0.0.1:5500/set1.html). In the webapp, users can select which tile they want to view and zoom in/out by clicking the plus/minus sign showing up at the left upper conner. The layer switchers can also be turned on/off by clicking them.
### The first tile is a base map provided by MapBox

I edited the basemap by adding green areas of Seattle and surrounding areas. Also, I changed the font and color to make the location more visible. You can see there are decent amount of green areas in Seattle and surrounding areas.
### The second tile is a thematic layer made by Seattle Landfill data

I chose a dark basemap to make the landfill areas more visible. As you can see from the screenshot, there are 5 major landfill places in Seattle and spread out evenly. It promises that each area in Seattle has an access to its nearby landfill.
### The third tile is a layer group composed of the first and second tile

This tile is a combination of the first and second tile. Thus, you can see a comparasion between green areas and landfill in Seattle area. People can try to think about how to embrace the nature and preserve these green areas.
### The fourth tile is a map layer with a rocky theme

This tile is a rocky theme.The water/river is in blue color and land/soil is in brown color. I chose this theme to advocate people to embrace the nature and remember the land we live in is the gift from the earth. When people dispose garbage, they ought to think about our environment and try to make it better.
