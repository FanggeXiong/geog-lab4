# geog-lab4 - Landfill in Seattle with a rocky theme
In lab4, I made four tile sets of Seattle. The map can be accessed [here](http://127.0.0.1:5500/set1.html). In the webapp, users can select which tile they want to view and zoom in/out by clicking the plus/minus sign showing up at the left upper conner. 
### The first tile is a base map provided by MapBox
I edited the basemap by adding green areas of Seattle and surrounding areas. Also, I changed the font and color to make the location more visible.
